.SYNOPSIS
    Migrates users from one primary domain to another
.DESCRIPTION
    This script retrieves all user from a specified domain and adds the new specified domain as their primary address.
    It checks the list of users against and exception list that will not perform the task if those usernames are present in the list.
    Users without a license or with sign-in blocked will also be excluded.
.NOTES
    This logic is now depreciated as the modules used are no longer supported.
    Need to translate to MS Graph
